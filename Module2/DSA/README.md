	Please selection option (1 - 9) :


2. Enter any options from the given menu (1 -9) 
   
	2.1 If menu = 1 the user is provided with a sorted array list (using merge sort algorithm) of 1000 random integers.
	    2.1.1 The user needs to enter number to search.
                  
 			If the integer exists in the array list, record found message is shown. Otherwise, record not found message is shown.
 		    Also, the user is displayed with the algorithm execution time.

		  	After the operation in step 2.1 is complete, the user is asked whether to exit from the system (y or n).

		  	If the user enters 'y', then the user exits from the system.Else the step (1) is repeated.
 
	2.2 If menu = 2 the user is provided with a sorted array list of 1000 integers (using quick sort algorithm).
	    		
	    	Also, the user is displayed with the algorithm execution time.

	    	After the operation in step 2.2 is complete, the user is asked whether to exit from the system (y or n).

	    	If the user enters 'y', then the user exits from the system.Else the step (1) is repeated.

	2.3 If menu = 3 the user is provided with a sorted array list of 1000 integers (using merge sort algorithm).


	    	Also, the user is displayed with the algorithm execution time.

	    	After the operation in step 2.3 is complete, the user is asked whether to exit from the system (y or n).
